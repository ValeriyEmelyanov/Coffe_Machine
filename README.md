### Cofee Machine
Design a program and write a class that represents the coffee machine.
The class should have a method that takes a string as input. 
Every time the user inputs a line (a string) to the console, 
the program invokes this method with one argument: 
the line that user input to the console. 
The class should not use system input at all; 
it only should handle input that comes to it via this method and its string argument.
